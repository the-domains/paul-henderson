It was sweltering.  The drops of sweat beading down my face were of little relief as the Florida sun beat down on my suit. The entire class was donned in MOPP 4 gear, the highest level of protection from biological and chemical agents. Earlier, we raced to throw on the charcoal coated garments over our military issued Battle Dress Uniforms (BDU's), completely encapsulated with the drawstrings cinched tight around our waist and gas mask. Duck tape was liberally applied to the ends of our rubber boots and gloves, creating an air tight uniform. Finally, gas mask seal checks were completed followed by inspections to ensure each step had been precisely followed. It was finally time.

I considered myself lucky. The heat never bothered me. Having spent nine years living near the equator, 100 plus degree temperatures mixed with one-hundred percent humidity was just another normal day. It was just after nine am, and the temperatures had barely creeped into the 80's, so I was more excited than anything. I'm not sure if my classmates shared in the enthusiasm, but it made no difference. We all stood there, listening to our instructor balk out instructions for our next two hour block of training. There was always an emphasis on staying hydrated, and this morning was no different as each of us was told to take a few sips of water. This was no small feat and I always considered it an annoyance to drink with my gas mask on. After releasing the canteen from my belt, I inserted the hose that connected to my mask and then moved my lips around in a fleeting attempt to find the internal straw. A few centimeters past the nozzle was an indentation for your teeth to rest on as you sucked water into your mouth at an excruciatingly slow rate. It always tasted like drinking plastic and the dehydrating effort always seemed to negate the amount of water consumed.

The next two hours would be a relief. No mental skill involved; just physical pain mixed with a personal cocoon sauna and a mask to mimic the effects of an asthma attack. But this I could handle. I was a spry twenty year old in the best shape of my life and any alternative to the ongoing mental testing was a much needed break. The session began under the watchful eye of the instructor who would stop at nothing to weed out a slacker. A tech sergeant in the Air Force, he was known for a no-nonsense attitude with a demeanor to match. His face was rough from years of wear and his uniform was never perfect; just ruffled enough to show an exhaustion from fitful nights of sleep recalling past deployments. He did not believe in second chances, specifically in this career, and demanded excellence on the battlefield. Two fingers half missing were a sign of something gone terribly wrong in past, but dared not be spoken of in the present.
