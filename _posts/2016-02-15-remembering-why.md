It was sweltering.  The drops of sweat beading down my face were of little relief as the Florida sun beat down on my suit. The entire class was donned in MOPP 4 gear, the highest level of protection from biological and chemical agents. Earlier, we raced to throw on the charcoal coated garments over our military issued Battle Dress Uniforms (BDU's), completely encapsulated with the drawstrings cinched tight around our waist and gas mask. Duck tape was liberally applied to the ends of our rubber boots and gloves, creating an air tight uniform. Gas mask seal checks were completed followed by inspections to ensure each step had been precisely followed. It was finally time.

I considered myself lucky. The heat never bothered me. Having spent nine years living near the equator, 100 plus degree temperatures mixed with one-hundred percent humidity was just another normal day. It was just after nine am, and the temperatures had barely creeped into the 80's, so I was more excited than anything. I'm not sure if my classmates shared in the enthusiasm, but it made no difference. We all stood there, listening to our instructor balk out instructions for our next two hour block of training. There was always an emphasis on staying hydrated, and this morning was no different as each of us was told to take a few sips of water. This was no small feat and I always considered it an annoyance to drink with my gas mask on. After releasing the canteen from my belt, I inserted the hose that connected to my mask and then moved my lips around in a fleeting attempt to find the internal straw. A few centimeters past the nozzle was an indentation for your teeth to rest on as you sucked water into your mouth at an excruciatingly slow rate. It always tasted like drinking plastic and the dehydrating effort always seemed to negate the amount of water consumed.

The next two hours would be a relief. No mental skill involved; just physical pain mixed with a personal cocoon sauna and a mask to mimic the effects of an asthma attack. But this I could handle. I was a spry twenty year old in the best shape of my life and any alternative to the ongoing mental testing was a much needed break. The session began under the watchful eye of the instructor who would stop at nothing to weed out a slacker. A tech sergeant in the Air Force, he was known for a no-nonsense attitude with a demeanor to match. His face was rough from years of wear and his uniform was never perfect; just ruffled enough to show an exhaustion from fitful nights of sleep recalling past deployments. He did not believe in second chances, specifically in this career, and demanded excellence on the battlefield. Two fingers missing from the second joint were a sign of something gone terribly wrong in the past, but dared not be spoken of in the present.

Push-ups, pull-ups, squats, sprints, sandbag carries, buddy carries, and of course every fifteen minutes, a mandatory thirst quenching of plastic tasting water. By now it was nearly 10 am and the temperature was quickly approaching 90 degrees. Those drops of sweat were permeating into my eyes, the salt creating a sting like a dive into the nearby Gulf of Mexico. The instructor reminded us to control our breathing as we were not allowed to remove the mask that was at least somewhat responsible for the lack of oxygen in my lungs and the deplorable amount of sweat that had overtaken my entire body. But this I could handle. I was having fun; enjoying a morning of brainless activity which would be rudely interrupted after lunch with book work and testing. The pile of sandbags in front of me was four feet high. I wrapped my arms around one, the obtrusively large rubber gloves over yet another layer of sweat soaked cloth gloves, was making it difficult grab anything with my hands. The sandbag was thrown onto my right shoulder and I began to run the 100 feet to the other pile; a task performed numerous times in the last hour.  The mixture of deep sand and rubber boots made it seem as though quicksand had overtaken my legs.  I pressed on as my classmates were waiting for me to take their turn.  It was then something unusual happened.  Something everyone took notice of, but we continued to run under the watchful eye of the tech sergeant.

For those who had graduated from the core curriculum classes on the main base, future instruction took place at a remote training location about 30 minutes north by bus. Each morning we were dropped off and our day would begin with a quick meal in the chow hall followed by student roll call. Our class was currently in the Biological/Chemical Division, the fifth of nine blocks of instruction spread out over nearly a nine month period. I was having a rough time with the constant memorization. This was never a strong suit of mine. I have always thought of myself as more of an intellectual while being able to discuss topics with others before coming to a logical solution. Sitting down for hours at a time and memorizing line after line of data was never my cup of tea.  But here I was, doing exactly that with an immense amount of data, all of which had been classified by the government as "Secret". Unfortunately for me, this designation meant everything was kept under lock and key after class was completed. There would be no taking material home to continue studying. Time was of the essence and I crammed as much information as possible between instruction blocks, during lunch break, and the study hour just before the last bus left for base.

The off-site training location had only been open for a few years.  In late 1996, ground broke on the Department of Defense Joint Service mission which when opened

This was the United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal, a jointly staffed school training the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.
